    "\n",
    "Strands Agents supports the [Agent-to-Agent (A2A)](https://strandsagents.com/latest/documentation/docs/user-guide/concepts/multi-agent/agent-to-agent/), an open standard that defines how AI agents can discover, communicate, and collaborate with each other. Enabling seamless communication between AI agents across different platforms and implementations.\n",

    "### What is Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Agent-to-Agent protocol is an open standard that defines how AI agents can discover, communicate, and collaborate with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "A2A protocol support enables several powerful use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multi-Agent Workflows: Chain multiple specialized agents together\n",
    "- Agent Marketplaces: Discover and use agents from different providers\n",
    "- Cross-Platform Integration: Connect Strands agents with other A2A-compatible systems\n",
    "- Distributed AI Systems: Build scalable, distributed agent architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "### MCP vs A2A\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to understand how A2A relates to MCP, or Model Context Protocol. These are complementary standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "- MCP connects agents to tools, APIs, and resources with structured inputs/outputs. Think of it as how agents access their capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A2A facilitates dynamic communication between different agents as peers. It's how agents collaborate, delegate, and manage shared tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "They're complementary - MCP gives agents their tools, A2A enables collaboration.\n",
    "click\n",
    "\n",
    "### A2A Architecture \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primary Agent**: Initiates communication and delegates tasks (the \"manager\")\n",
    "- **Secondary Agent(s)**: Receive tasks and provide responses (the \"specialists\")\n",
    "- **A2A Tool**: Handles protocol details for seamless communication between the agents\n",
    "- **Message Protocol**: Defines message format and structure\n",
